### 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m passionate about using technology to make learning more inclusive and accessible.  
While volunteering at **Creciendo Juntos**, an educational center that supports neurodivergent children, I noticed how many students struggled with managing time during activities due to their special learning conditions.

Wanting to help, I developed **Contando Juntos**, a web app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that uses **music and visual cues** to help students stay calm and engaged in class 
Seeing its positive impact showed me how empathy and engineering can come together to create meaningful change.

I have also completed **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science**, where I strengthened my foundation in **algorithms, C, Python, and web development**.  
Now, I’m aim to continue exploring how **hardware and software** can work together to build systems that improve daily life — a path I hope to continue through **Computer Engineering**.
